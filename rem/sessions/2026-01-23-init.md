# Session State: 2026-01-23 - Initial Installation

## Current Focus
- Primary area: Full project initialization
- Last files touched: All Brain-Wave output files
- Analysis stage: Complete - system ready for use

## Active Context
- Components in scope: Alpha-Wave, Beta-Wave, REM (all agents)
- Patterns observed: Three-agent architecture, filesystem persistence
- Dependencies identified: Sequential agent execution order

## Project State
This is a new/empty project containing:
- The Brain-Wave Memory System agents and rules
- CLAUDE.md project instructions
- Reference PDF article

No application code exists yet - the system is ready for when code is added.

## Completed Actions
- [x] Created alpha-wave/ with INDEX.md, TOPICS.md, STATE.md
- [x] Created alpha-wave/summaries/ with 6 file summaries
- [x] Created beta-wave/ with _MAP.md, _CONNECTIONS.md, _PATTERNS.md, _DECISIONS.md
- [x] Created rem/ with sessions/, discoveries/, restoration/
- [x] Installed memory hooks in .claude/rules/

## Next Actions
- [ ] Add application code to the project
- [ ] Run `use rem agent` periodically to sync
- [ ] On new sessions, check `rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md`

## Git State
- Branch: main
- Last commit: 4bff4ef initial
- Uncommitted changes: Brain-Wave output files (all new)

## Notes
This session captured the complete Brain-Wave system initialization. The project is now ready for development - all memory infrastructure is in place.
