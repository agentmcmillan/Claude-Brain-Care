# Context Restoration Protocol
> Last updated: 2026-01-23

## Quick Restore (< 1 minute)
For resuming after a short break:

1. Read `rem/sessions/2026-01-23-init.md` for immediate context
2. Read `alpha-wave/INDEX.md` for file overview
3. Check `rem/discoveries/` for key insights

## Full Restore (< 5 minutes)
For resuming after a longer break:

1. All Quick Restore steps
2. Read `beta-wave/_MAP.md` for architecture
3. Read `beta-wave/_CONNECTIONS.md` for dependencies
4. Read relevant `beta-wave/[area]/_MAP.md` for current focus

## Deep Restore (as needed)
For full context rebuild after long absence:

1. All Full Restore steps
2. Read `alpha-wave/summaries/` for specific files
3. Read `rem/discoveries/` for accumulated insights
4. Read `rem/sessions/` history for context evolution

## Current State Summary
- Files indexed: 8
- Directories mapped: 4
- Discoveries logged: 6
- Sessions captured: 1
- Last focus area: System initialization

## Entry Points
1. **Main**: `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview
2. **Rules**: `.claude/rules/brain-wave-system.md` - System docs
3. **Index**: `alpha-wave/INDEX.md` - File listing
4. **Map**: `beta-wave/_MAP.md` - Architecture

## Project Status
This is a new project containing only the Brain-Wave Memory System infrastructure. No application code exists yet.

### What's Ready
- Alpha-Wave indexing system
- Beta-Wave mapping system
- REM monitoring and sessions
- Memory hooks in .claude/rules/

### What's Needed
- Application code to be added
- Periodic `use rem agent` runs after changes

## Active Concerns
- None - fresh installation complete

## Restore Commands

```
# Quick context check
Read rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md

# See all files
Read alpha-wave/INDEX.md

# Understand architecture
Read beta-wave/_MAP.md

# Check recent session
Read rem/sessions/2026-01-23-init.md

# Sync after changes
use rem agent
```
