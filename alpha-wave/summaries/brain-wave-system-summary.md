> Purpose: System documentation and context restoration

## Purpose
Comprehensive documentation of the Brain-Wave Memory System that auto-loads on every Claude Code session via the `.claude/rules/` mechanism.

## Key Sections
- **The Agents**: Alpha-Wave, Beta-Wave, REM descriptions
- **Context Restoration Protocol**: Quick, Deep, Full restore procedures
- **Memory Locations**: Table of all output files and their purposes
- **Workflow**: New project and ongoing usage patterns

## Key Tables
- Memory locations with update ownership
- Agent commands and purposes

## Dependencies
- Requires: `alpha-wave/`, `beta-wave/`, `rem/` folders to exist
- Auto-loaded by: Claude Code on session start

## Patterns
- Uses markdown tables for structured data
- Provides tiered restoration protocols
- Links to memory files via `@` syntax

## Notes
- This is the primary context hook for the system
- Must remain in `.claude/rules/` to auto-load
