# REM Context Restoration

## On Session Start
Load context from the REM memory system:

### Quick Context
- @rem/sessions/2026-01-23-init.md - Latest session state
- @rem/restoration/PROTOCOL.md - How to restore full context

### If Working on Specific Area
Check for `beta-wave/[area]/_MAP.md`

### Key Discoveries
- @rem/discoveries/architecture.md - Structural patterns
- @rem/discoveries/conventions.md - Naming and format conventions

## Session Statistics
- Last REM run: 2026-01-23
- Changes since: 0 (fresh installation)
- Sync status: In-sync

## Restore Levels
1. **Quick** (< 1 min): Latest session + INDEX.md
2. **Full** (< 5 min): Add architecture maps
3. **Deep** (as needed): All summaries and history
